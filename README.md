# Seneca Academic Honesty Management System

A system made for a client at Seneca College. This project includes 3 key functionalities:

* Report Offenses
* View/edit existing offenses
* View and respond to outstanding offenses

## Report Offenses

Professors can log into the system to report any offenses that their students have committed. They can include students, course, date, and related documents when submitting a report. They can also specify whether the offense is "minor" or "major."

## View/edit existing offenses

Professors may log in and see all reports they have submitted. Information can also be edited in case the situation has changed since the initial report.

Academic Committee members can view all reports, as well as respond to the offenses (schedule meeting, close case, etc). Committee members can also view student profiles to see their offense history.

## View and respond to outstanding offenses

Students can view offenses they have been convicted of, and then choose to respond to them.
